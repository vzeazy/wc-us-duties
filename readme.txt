In the era of 'America First' tariffs, where imports get taxed like they're crossing the border wall, this plugin helps you estimate US duties at checkout and manage customs profiles like a tariff titan. HPOS-compatible, with JSON/CSV importers, WPML-ready currency, and CUSMA handling – because even trade deals need a MAGA makeover!

== Description ==

Welcome to WooCommerce US Duties & Customs, your hilarious guide to the Trump tariff jungle! Slap those import duties on your customers' purchases and watch the profits soar higher than a Trump rally crowd. Manage customs profiles with HS codes and rates, support CUSMA duty-free for our northern and southern amigos, grab live FX rates from exchangerate.host, and stay WPML-ready for when the world speaks in tongues. Import data from Zonos JSON or CSV, bulk-assign customs fields, and turn your WooCommerce store into a tariff-teering machine – 'Make America Expensive Again'!

Features:
- Checkout fee (DDP) or info-only (DAP) – because tariffs are the new black!
- Line-item CUSMA duty-free for CA/US origins (configurable) – NAFTA who? CUSMA rules!
- Shipping channel mapping (postal vs commercial) – choose your poison, tariff style.
- JSON/CSV importers for profiles; CSV assigner for products – data import faster than Trump's tweet storms.
- Admin grid with search, pagination, edit, bulk delete, and impacted products drilldown – manage like a boss, tariff edition.
- WPML multi-currency compatibility; exchangerate.host FX cache – because dollars aren't the only currency in Trump's world.
- HPOS compatible; order snapshot stored in meta – future-proof like Trump's hair.

== Installation ==

Install and activate. Head to WooCommerce → Customs & Duties to configure settings, import customs profiles, and assign those tariff fields to your products. It's easier than building a wall!
